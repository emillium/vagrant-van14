```
egrep -c ‘(svm|vmx)’ /proc/cpuinfo
```

A 0 indicates that your CPU doesn’t support hardware virtualization, while a 1 or more indicates that it does.
You may still have to enable hardware virtualization support in your computer’s BIOS, even if this command returns a 1 or more.

```
sudo apt-get install qemu-kvm libvirt-bin bridge-utils virt-manager
```

You may need to perform this step

```
sudo adduser name libvirtd
```

Logout of and log back in, kvm is now available
